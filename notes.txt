Convert the provided site to use a responsive design .
1. All responsiveness should be done with CSS; Bootstrap and other CSS frameworks should not be used.
2. Use appropriate document type declaration and viewport tags
3. Create a responsive grid-based layout using CSS
4. Use media queries that provide fluid breakpoints across different screen sizes
5. Use responsive images that adjust for the dimensions and resolution of any mobile device
6. Implement accessibility features in the site HTML (most of this HTML is generated by JavaScript functions).
7. Add a ServiceWorker script to cache requests to all of the siteâ€™s assets so that any page that has been visited by a user will be accessible when the user is offline. Only caching needs to be implemented, no other ServiceWorker features.

RESPONSIVE DESIGN

IS THE SITE UI COMPATIBLE WITH A RANGE OF DISPLAY SIZES?

* All content is responsive and displays on a range of display sizes.
* Content should make use of available screen real estate and should display correctly at all screen sizes.
* An image's associated title and text renders next to the image in all viewport sizes.

ARE IMAGES RESPONSIVE?

* Images in the site are sized appropriate to the viewport and do not crowd or overlap other elements in the browser, regardless of viewport size.

ARE APPLICATION ELEMENTS VISIBLE AND USABLE IN ALL VIEWPORTS?

* On the main page, restaurants and images are displayed in all viewports.
* The detail page includes a map, hours and reviews in all viewports.


ACCESSIBILITY

ARE IMAGES ACCESSIBLE?

* All content-related images include appropriate alternate text that clearly describes the content of the image.

IS FOCUS USED APPROPRIATELY TO ALLOW EASY NAVIGATION OF THE SITE?

* Focus is appropriately managed allowing users to noticeably tab through each of the important elements of the page. Modal or interstitial windows appropriately lock focus.

ARE SITE ELEMENTS DEFINED SEMANTICALLY?

* Elements on the page use the appropriate semantic elements. For those elements in which a semantic element is not available, appropriate ARIA roles are defined.


OFFLINE AVAILABILITY

ARE PAGES THAT HAVE BEEN VISITED AVAILABLE OFFLINE?

* When available in the browser, the site uses a service worker to cache responses to requests for site assets. Visited pages are rendered when there is no network access.
